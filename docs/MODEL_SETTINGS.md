# Desktop model settings

Open **Settings → Models → Access**, or choose **Manage models** from the chat model menu.

Settings fills the application window. Use **Back to workspace** to return to the same workspace; reopening settings remembers the last category during this app session. Escape closes a child dialog or menu, but does not exit the settings page.

Select a saved provider in the left column to edit its connection and models. Switching providers keeps open forms' drafts. **Save** applies the form; **Cancel** discards it. Closing settings discards unsaved forms.

## Add a provider

- **Recommended presets:** open the compact selector and search by name. Select a preset, enter its API key, then add it. Installed/conflicting presets retain their status. Products with several protocol routes remain grouped; individual routes are available under advanced route settings.
- **Custom provider:** enter a name, protocol, Base URL, and key. The form previews the request URL. Special gateway paths can use **Override request URL** under compatibility settings; it takes precedence over Base URL. Existing exact URLs and legacy Chat URLs retain their request behavior.

An empty key field on an existing provider keeps the saved credential. Use the separate clear-key action to remove it.

## Save and apply

Model settings can be saved before startup finishes, after startup fails, or with no active session. Saving does not create a session or send a model request.

| Setting | When it takes effect |
| --- | --- |
| Default chat model | New sessions only; existing sessions keep their selected model |
| Planner, vision, search, and subagent models or reasoning preferences | Before the next run in each affected session |
| Connection URL, protocol, key, model catalog, or capability | Before the next run; accepted work keeps its original connection |
| Remove a provider/model/access, or clear a key | Accepted work finishes; the next run selects a validated available fallback, or is blocked until a model is configured |
| Explicitly switch the current session model | Applies to that session, retaining its existing busy-work and session-ownership checks |

An accepted run includes its planning, tools, retries, approval waits, and children. A queued follow-up, scheduled task, or new bot request is a new run. Explicit project configuration continues to override global preferences.

The page distinguishes **saved, pending application** from **saved, application failed**. The latter lists the affected sessions and offers **Retry application**. Retry uses the latest saved configuration; it does not save the key again. A failed application retains the previous controller and history but blocks affected new runs. Editing while a save is in progress retains the newer draft.

Desktop-managed remote sessions use immutable tunnel tokens. Remote browser turns and queued follow-ups check Desktop settings before starting; existing requests keep their old token until their work ends. An older Serve without snapshot support must be upgraded or safely reconnected after its current work finishes. Desktop does not force-stop it to apply a setting. Independently configured remote sessions continue to use remote configuration.

## Recovery and older versions

Configuration remains TOML, credentials remain in `.env`, and conversation history keeps its existing format. A key change writes a fresh credential reference before committing the configuration that names it. A failure before the configuration commit leaves the old connection usable; it may leave an unreferenced new credential. Cleanup only considers references created by that failed edit. It does not scan or delete user-defined credential variables.

After a lost save response, the page reads the request receipt and current settings before offering another save. If the process restarted and the result cannot be confirmed, review the saved values first. It does not automatically repeat an uncertain credential write.

Older versions can read the saved TOML and `.env` references. Downgrading loses the new application behavior and can reintroduce the active-session dependency and immediate runtime refresh defects. Downgrade does not require deleting configuration or history.

Implementation and qualification evidence are tracked in [Model settings runtime validation](MODEL_SETTINGS_RUNTIME_VALIDATION.md).

## Manage models

**Refresh models** opens a searchable selection dialog. Existing models are checked and locked. **Add selected models** appends only selected new models to the form; save the provider to apply them. Discovery failure does not prevent manual entry.

**Add manually** and each row's edit button open a model dialog. Enter the exact model ID, optional context/output limits, and image capability. Empty limits inherit defaults. Output `-1` omits optional limits; protocols requiring a limit still use their fallback. Image **Auto** uses metadata; overrides must match the endpoint's actual capability. Editing limits preserves existing reasoning overrides.

Deleting a model stages its removal; cancel the provider form to undo it. The default model stays unchanged if it remains in the list, otherwise the first remaining model becomes the provider default.

**Test model** sends a short request through the selected adapter with no conversation history or tools. It uses the current form, including an unsaved key, and may incur a small provider charge. Neither testing nor discovery saves credentials or configuration. Editing the connection invalidates previous test results. Success confirms that the request was accepted, not every model capability.

The chat menu groups saved, available models by provider and displays context/image metadata when available. Editing model settings does not change system prompts or tool schemas.

## Windows window behavior

Windows settings keeps the minimize, maximize/restore, and close-window buttons at the top right. The title strip and caption buttons share a 48 CSS px height and the settings background, independently of the underlying Workbench or Creation layout. The empty title strip is draggable; the Back button, form controls, and caption buttons are not drag regions.

**Back to workspace** only leaves settings. **Close window** retains the configured close behavior in General settings. A model dialog's close button only dismisses that dialog.

### Windows reference research and validation boundary (2026-09-05)

- Reference: ZCode for Windows.
- Installed application code confirms native Windows caption buttons, a transparent title-bar overlay with a 48px baseline updated with UI zoom, a full-page settings component, separate return and window-close actions, and configurable close-to-tray behavior.
- Reasonix applies the same shared caption geometry and colors to settings through the Electron shell's window controls.
- Reasonix's Windows browser preview was checked for caption geometry, colors, and Workbench/Creation transitions. Settings navigation and child-dialog tests also passed.
- Native Windows dragging, system scaling, maximize, and tray acceptance checks remain unverified. Installed-code inspection does not replace those checks.
